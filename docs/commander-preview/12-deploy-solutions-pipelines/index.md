# 🚀 Mission 12: Deploy Agents with Solutions & Pipelines

## 🕵️‍♂️ **CLASSIFIED**

## 🎯 Mission Brief

Plan and execute enterprise application lifecycle management (ALM) for your agents. Understand environment strategies for dev, test, and production, and package agents in custom solutions with managed and unmanaged layers. Export and import solutions across environments, create reusable component collections, and configure agent connections with On-Behalf-Of (OBO) authentication. Control sharing with Editor and Viewer roles and deploy at scale using Power Platform Pipelines.

## 🔎 Objectives

In this mission, you'll learn:

1. How to plan environment strategies for dev, test, and production, including trial-to-production conversion and backup/restore operations
1. How to create custom solutions, manage solution layers (managed vs unmanaged), and export/import with required objects
1. How to create and share reusable component collections with dependency management
1. How to configure agent connections, On-Behalf-Of (OBO) authentication, and sharing with Editor and Viewer roles
1. How to deploy solutions at scale using Power Platform Pipelines
