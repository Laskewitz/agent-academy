# 🤝 Mission 04: Human in the Loop (HITL)

## 🕵️‍♂️ **CLASSIFIED**

## 🎯 Mission Brief

Build multistage approval workflows in agent flows that combine AI-driven decisions with manual human review stages. Configure the Human in the Loop connector with manual and AI approval stages, conditions for dynamic routing, and the Request for Information (RFI) action to pause flows and collect structured input from reviewers. Map flow variables to approval inputs, write effective AI stage instructions, and review decisions in the approvals center.
