# 🐍 Mission 03: Code Interpreter

## 🕵️‍♂️ **CLASSIFIED**

## 🎯 Mission Brief

Enable Code Interpreter to generate and execute Python code in a sandbox for data preparation, statistical analysis, table joins, forecasting, charting, and file generation using structured data (CSV, Excel). Leverage deterministic, reproducible computation instead of best-effort LLM reasoning. Ingest data via user-uploaded files in chat or SharePoint Documents library knowledge sources. Combine with image generation and custom skills to extend agent capabilities. Query and update Dataverse using code.

## 🔎 Objectives

In this mission, you'll learn:

1. How to enable Code Interpreter at the prompt and agent level
1. How to analyze structured data (CSV, Excel) for data preparation, statistical analysis, forecasting, and chart generation
1. The difference between deterministic (prompt-level) and non-deterministic (agent-level) execution
1. How to ingest structured data via user-uploaded files or SharePoint knowledge sources
1. How to extend capabilities with image generation, custom skills, and Dataverse code queries
