# 🌍 Mission 06: Localization

## 🕵️‍♂️ **CLASSIFIED**

## 🎯 Mission Brief

Configure multilingual agents that communicate in different languages and handle regional date and time correctly. Set primary and secondary languages, manage localization with JSON and ResX translation files, and enable automatic or dynamic language switching using generative orchestration. Localize Adaptive Cards with dynamic content, accommodate time zones using system variables and Power Fx, and test multilingual experiences in the test panel.

## 🔎 Objectives

In this mission, you'll learn:

1. How to configure primary and secondary languages with region settings
1. How to manage localization using JSON and ResX translation files
1. How to set up automatic language detection and dynamic language switching with generative orchestration
1. How to localize Adaptive Cards and test multilingual experiences in the test panel
1. How to accommodate time zones using `Conversation.LocalTimeZone`, Noda Time zone IDs, and Power Fx date conversion
