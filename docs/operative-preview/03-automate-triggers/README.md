## ü§î What is an Event trigger?

Previously in [Recruit](../../recruit/10-add-event-triggers/README.md), we learnt about event triggers. Let's do a quick recap on this in case you missed it.

**Event triggers** let an agent _act_ on _its_ own when something happens in another system - no user message required. When the configured event fires - such as ‚Äúnew SharePoint item,‚Äù ‚Äúnew email,‚Äù ‚ÄúPlanner task assigned,‚Äù or even a time‚Äëbased recurrence, a connector sends a trigger payload to your agent. The agent then follows your instructions to decide which actions or topics to call.

### Key characteristics

- **Autonomous activation:**
      - Unlike topic triggers that start when a user types to the agent, event triggers fire from external events, enabling proactive behavior.

- **Payload-driven:**
      - Each event delivers a payload (variables + optional instructions) through a connector. The agent uses your defined instructions and the payload to choose what to do next.
      - For example _call a topic_ or _execute actions defined by Tools_.

- **Examples out-of-the-box:**
      - SharePoint/OneDrive file or item created
      - Planner task completed/assigned
      - Microsoft Forms response submitted
      - Recurrence/schedule

    Availability depends on your organization‚Äôs data policies configured in Power Automate.

- **Requires generative orchestration:**
      - Event triggers are available only when generative orchestration is enabled for the agent.

- **Billing/usage:**
      - Each trigger delivery counts as a message toward Copilot Studio capacity.
      - For example a 10‚Äëminute recurrence sends a message every 10 minutes.

- **Auth model and setup:**
      - You add triggers within the agent Overview, under _Triggers_. Authentication for the trigger connector uses the agent maker‚Äôs account (‚Äúagent author authentication‚Äù).
      - You can edit trigger parameters and payload in the Power Automate maker portal.

- **Testing & observability:**
      - You can test triggers from the agent's test pane and inspect behavior with the activity map before publishing.

!!! info "TL;DR for developers"

    Think of event triggers as **webhook-like signals** that push a structured payload into your agent, letting it _initiate_ work and chain actions across systems - without waiting for a user to ask.

### Topic triggers - how they differ

Previously you learnt about topic triggers in [Recruit](../../recruit/07-add-new-topic-with-trigger/README.md), however you might still be wondering how _Topic_ triggers differ from _Event_ triggers, and why that distinction matters for understanding what makes an agent autonomous.

Topic triggers control _when a topic runs_, usually in response to a user message.

- In generative orchestration, the default trigger is **By agent** - the planner chooses a topic whose name/description best matches the user‚Äôs message.
- In classic orchestration, the default is **Phrases** - the planner chooses a topic when one or several trigger phrases best matches the user's message.

Other trigger types include `Message received`, `Event received`, `Activity received`, `Conversation update`, `Invoke received`, `On redirect`, `Inactivity`, and `Plan complete`.

!!! info "Core difference"

    Topic triggers are _conversation activity_ starters inside the chat.
    
    Event triggers are system _event_ starters delivered via connectors that can run the agent without any conversation at all.

### Quick guide of Topic trigger vs Event trigger

- **Topic trigger:** User (or chat activity) said/did X ‚û°Ô∏è run Topic T.
- **Event trigger:** SharePoint/Planner/Email/Timer fired with payload P ‚û°Ô∏è agent evaluates instructions ‚û°Ô∏è call Actions/Topics accordingly.

## üèì Interactive agent vs Autonomous agent - comparison

Now that you know the difference between event triggers and topics triggers, let's next learn about the difference between an interactive agent vs an autonomous agent.

In Copilot Studio terms, "interactive" maps to agents that primarily engage via **topics** in a chat of channel. "Autonomous" maps to agents that also leverage **event triggers** to run without user input.

The following table summarizes their differences and similarities.

| Dimension                           | Interactive agent     | Autonomous agent                                                                                              |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| How it starts                       | User (or chat activity) triggers a topic. Example: By agent, Phrases, Message received.   | External event trigger sends a payload via connector to the agent. Example: SharePoint, Planner, email, schedule, etc. |
| Primary use                         | Q&A, guided workflows, request-driven actions in chat - Teams, web, etc.  | Proactive operations and background automation - react to system changes and then notify, file, or orchestrate tasks. |
| Trigger surface                     | Topic triggers: By agent / Phrases / Message received / Activity types / Invoke / Inactivity / Plan complete | Event triggers library via connectors; payload includes event data + optional instructions. |
| Planner (generative orchestration)  | Strongly leveraged for By agent and Plan complete triggers to select/sequence topics. | Required for event triggers; the agent uses instructions + payload to decide which actions/topics to call. |
| Typical example                     | User asks "What's our refund policy?" ‚Üí Topic runs, queries knowledge, response. | New Planner task assigned ‚Üí Event trigger fires ‚Üí Agent posts a Teams message, updates a record, or calls a topic. |
| Setup path                          | Create topics, define trigger type, author dialog/actions; publish to channels. | Add event trigger (Overview ‚Üí Triggers), authenticate connector with agent author credentials, configure payload/instructions; test via test pane; publish. |
| Auth and governance                 | Runs under channel/auth context; topic triggers respond to chat activities in allowed channels. | Trigger availability depends on Power Automate data policies; connectors run under the agent maker‚Äôs account. |
| Observability                       | Test topics within Copilot Studio, inspect conversation transcripts/activities. | Use Test trigger and activity map to validate execution before publishing, monitor activity after publishing. |
| Capacity impact                     | Each user message/agent response is a message consuming capacity. | Each event delivery is also a message, plus any subsequent actions. Example: a 10‚Äëminute recurrence = 6 messages/hour |

### When to use which?

- Choose **topic triggers (interactive)** when users initiate the agent conversation - FAQ, guided intake, or command‚Äëstyle tasks inside chat. The planner‚Äôs By agent trigger reduces manual phrase curation.
- Add **event triggers (autonomous)** when the agent should start the conversation or take action itself - on updates in SharePoint/Dataverse, incoming email, or on a schedule. This moves you from reactive to proactive operations.

## Developer tips & gotchas

1. **Enable generative orchestration** for any agent you want to make autonomous. Event triggers won‚Äôt show up otherwise.

1. **Model the payload early.** Decide what minimal fields your agent needs from the trigger such as `itemId`, `assignedTo`, `dueDate` and add concise instructions that tell the agent which action/topic to call based on payload values.

1. **Auth scope matters.** Triggers authenticate using the agent maker‚Äôs account. Ensure that account has the right connector permissions and complies with Power Automate data policies.

1. **Control cost and noise.** High‚Äëfrequency recurrences or highly chatty sources can rack up message consumption quickly - throttle where possible or add conditions in the trigger to filter events.

1. **Test before publishing.** Use **Test trigger** and the activity map to watch the plan and called actions - iterate on instructions/payload until behavior is stable.
