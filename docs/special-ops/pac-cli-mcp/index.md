## 🤖 Power Platform CLI MCP

Here's where things get interesting, agent. The Power Platform CLI (version 1.44+) includes a built-in **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** — your direct comm link between AI assistants and Power Platform environments. This integration allows you to issue orders using natural language in supported AI tools like VS Code Copilot, Visual Studio, and other MCP-compatible applications.

### 🚀 What is MCP Integration?

The MCP server exposes Power Platform CLI commands as tools that AI assistants can invoke on your behalf. Instead of memorizing classified CLI syntax, you simply describe your mission objectives in natural language, and the AI executes the appropriate commands.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Natural Language Interface** - Issue commands in plain English instead of remembering classified CLI syntax
- **Intelligent Command Selection** - Your AI handler selects the right commands based on your intent
- **Contextual Assistance** - Get operational support without leaving your command center
- **Selective Tool Access** - Control which CLI commands are exposed for operational security

### 📋 Supported Operations

The MCP server currently supports **20+ Power Platform CLI commands** in its arsenal:

- **Environment Management** - List, create, and manage Power Platform environments
- **Solution Operations** - Import, export, and package solutions
- **Authentication** - Handle auth profiles and tenant connections
- **Dataverse Operations** - Work with tables, data, and configurations
- **Power Pages** - Manage website deployments and configurations
- **Component Management** - Handle PCF controls and other components

### ⚙️ Setting Up PAC CLI MCP

#### 1. Locate the MCP Executable

After deploying Power Platform CLI via the .NET tool, the MCP server executable is stationed at:

```text
%USERPROFILE%\.dotnet\tools\.store\microsoft.powerapps.cli.tool\[version]\microsoft.powerapps.cli.tool\[version]\tools\net8.0\any\pac-mcp.exe
```

**Quick way to locate the asset:**

```bash
pac copilot mcp
```

This command will reveal the exact path to your `pac-mcp.exe` file. Copy the path — you'll need it for the next phase of the operation.

#### 2. Establish the MCP Connection in Visual Studio Code

To wire up the Power Platform CLI MCP server in Visual Studio Code:

1. Open Visual Studio Code command palette (`ctrl` + `shift` + `P` on Windows/Linux or `cmd` + `shift` + `P` on Mac)
1. Search for "MCP" and select `MCP: Add Server`
1. Select `Command (stdio)`
1. Paste the full path to `pac-mcp.exe` that you acquired from the `pac copilot mcp` command in step 1
1. Name the server something like for instance:

    ```text
    Power Platform CLI MCP
    ```

This should add the MCP server to your MCP configuration in Visual Studio Code. It should also be running. If it's not — activate it. No dormant assets on this mission.

### 🛡️ Security and Tool Selection

Operational security is paramount. The MCP integration allows you to **selectively enable** specific CLI commands, giving you full control over which operations the AI can perform. This ensures your perimeter stays tight by limiting access to only the tools required for the mission.

**Best Practices:**

- Enable only the commands your mission requires
- Review tool permissions before granting access — trust but verify
- Use environment-specific configurations for different operations
- Monitor MCP server logs for all executed commands

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

If things go sideways, here's your field manual:

**Common Issues:**

1. **MCP Server Not Found**
   - Verify the path to `pac-mcp.exe` using `pac copilot mcp`
   - Ensure Power Platform CLI version 1.44+ is installed

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - Run `pac auth list` to verify your authentication profiles
   - Set up authentication using `pac auth create` if needed

1. **Tool Access Warnings**
   - Check the Output window in VS Code for MCP-related messages
   - Verify tool permissions in MCP server configuration

Once all assets are in place, you're cleared to leverage natural language commands to manage your Power Platform tenant settings.

Managing tenant settings through the Power Platform CLI offers several tactical advantages over using the Power Platform Admin Center alone:

### 🎯 Tactical Advantages of CLI-Based Tenant Settings Management

Here are the key advantages you'll gain by managing tenant settings through the CLI instead of the admin center. Each advantage demonstrates how the CLI strengthens your operational capabilities.

#### Comprehensive Settings Access

The Power Platform Admin Center doesn't expose all available tenant settings through its user interface. Using `pac admin list-tenant-settings`, you can access the complete set of tenant configurations — including classified settings that aren't visible in the web portal.

#### Bulk Operations

Instead of manually clicking through dozens of settings in the admin center, the CLI allows you to update multiple tenant settings in a single sweep. This is mission-critical when configuring new tenants, standardizing settings across multiple environments, or rolling out organization-wide policy changes.

#### Version Control & Documentation

By downloading tenant settings to JSON files using `pac admin list-tenant-settings --settings-file`, you can:

- Track changes over time with version control systems like Git
- Maintain configuration snapshots for compliance audits
- Document your tenant configuration as code
- Compare settings between different environments or points in time

#### Automation & DevOps Integration

CLI commands can be integrated into automated deployment pipelines, enabling you to:

- Apply consistent tenant configurations across development, staging, and production
- Include tenant settings as part of your infrastructure-as-code strategy
- Automate compliance checks and policy enforcement
- Eliminate human error from configuration management

#### Disaster Recovery

Having your tenant settings documented in JSON format provides a reliable fallback that can be rapidly restored if things go south — ensuring operational continuity and minimizing downtime.

### 🤖 Bringing in the AI Handler

The Power Platform CLI MCP Server transforms tenant settings management by eliminating the need to memorize complex command syntax and parameter combinations. Instead of having to remember commands like `pac admin list-tenant-settings --settings-file "config.json"` or struggling to recall which specific parameters control environment creation policies, you simply tell your AI handler what you need done.

#### Example 1: Recon — Viewing Current Tenant Settings

Instead of remembering the exact CLI syntax to extract tenant settings, you can simply request specific intel:

```text
Show me the current tenant settings for trial environment creation
```

This will give you an output like this:

![Show trial environment creation setting](./assets/show-trial-env-creation-setting.png)

#### Example 2: Execution — Updating Tenant Settings

Rather than looking up the correct parameters for environment creation restrictions, describe the policy change you want to deploy:

```text
Update my tenant to restrict developer environment creation to admins only
```

This will give you an output like this:

![Restrict developer environment creation to admins only](./assets/restrict-developer-environments-to-admins-only.png)

GitHub Copilot will execute the appropriate CLI commands on your behalf — making Power Platform administration accessible to operatives who may not be fluent in command-line interfaces while still leveraging the full firepower of the CLI tools.

### 💡 Get strategic advice on tenant settings

While updating individual tenant settings one at a time can be useful for learning the ropes, the real power of combining Power Platform CLI with AI comes when you need to develop comprehensive governance strategies for your organization or clients. Instead of manually researching best practices across dozens of intel sources, you can leverage AI to analyze your current tenant configuration and produce a strategic roadmap.

Ask GitHub Copilot to give you a detailed battle plan on how to enforce Power Platform best practices across your organization. GitHub Copilot can analyze your current settings, identify vulnerabilities, and provide a phased implementation plan spanning the upcoming weeks and months. This approach transforms tenant management from reactive patching into proactive governance strategy.

Try this prompt — and watch your AI handler go to work:

```text
Analyze my current Power Platform tenant settings and provide a strategic governance improvement plan. Please provide:

1. An assessment of my current tenant configuration against Microsoft's recommended best practices
2. A prioritized list of settings that should be updated for better security, governance, and user experience  
3. A phased implementation roadmap for the next 3-6 months with:
   - Priority levels (Critical/High/Medium/Low) for each change
   - Risk assessment and business impact for each setting
   - Recommended implementation sequence
   - Communication considerations for stakeholders
4. Specific CLI commands I can use to implement each recommended change
5. Key monitoring points to track after implementation

Focus on enterprise governance, security compliance, and developer productivity optimization. Provide the plan as structured guidance rather than creating files or executing commands.
```
